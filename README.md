# Ruby controller command

### General

This project was created by scaffolding the controllers through the command line.

```
rails g scaffold controller
```

It has 4 different animals each with 4 related pages. This project was to help with my association between the scaffold command and the pages that are created.

### Cloning

You will need ruby (v 2.5.1) for this calculator to work.

You will also need to run the command:
```
bundle
```
or
```
bundle install
```
to use the gems I have in this project.

You will then need to create a database to hold your users on by running:
```
rails db:create
```
